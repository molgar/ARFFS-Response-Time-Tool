A QGIS 3.x plugin for fire response time analysis: identifying the nearest fire station by travel time, generating OSM-based routes, and evaluating coverage based on fire incident ranks.

</p>

### Features
- **Nearest Fire Station (nearest_fire_station)**:
  - Identifies the nearest fire station based on the shortest travel time over the OSM road network.
  - Output attributes: `nearest_station`, `distance_km`, `response_time_min`, `station_x`, `station_y` + original object attributes.
- **Response Time Routes (response_time_routes)**:
  - Generates linear routes on the OSM road graph between incident locations and fire stations.
  - Modes: to the nearest station only; to all stations; to all stations within a specified time threshold.
  - Output attributes: `object_id`, `station_name`, `distance_km`, `response_time_min`, `object_type`, `route_type`.
- **All Stations Response by Fire Rank (all_stations_response)**:
  - Evaluates response times from multiple fire stations based on fire rank (1–5) and a configurable station limit.
  - Calculates `first_arrival_min`, `last_arrival_min`, `avg_arrival_min`, generates a `station_list`, and provides a `response_coverage` assessment.

### How It Works
- Internally uses the `graph_utils.py` module to:
  - Build an OSM road graph based on the extent of your input layers (with a small buffer),
  - Assign travel speeds by road type and compute travel time on graph edges,
  - Convert speeds from km/h to m/min.
- Algorithms automatically detect the station name field in the fire stations layer.
- Supports project coordinate reference systems (CRS): route geometries are automatically converted to/from WGS84.

- `graph_utils.py` constructs the road graph from the input layer extents with a buffer.
- The `set_graph_travel_times` function assigns speeds and populates the `travel_time` attribute on edges.
- Default speeds are defined for groups of OSM `highway` tags (see table below).

### Requirements
- QGIS: 3.16 – 3.99
- Internet access (required to fetch OSM road graph via OSMnx)
- Python dependencies in the QGIS environment: `osmnx`, `networkx` (usually `shapely` is already included with QGIS)

### Installing Dependencies (Windows, OSGeo4W/QGIS)
1) Open the **OSGeo4W Shell** (or **QGIS Python Console**).
2) Install the packages (specify versions compatible with your QGIS/Python build if needed):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install "osmnx>=1.4,<2.0" "networkx>=2.6,<3.0"
# If compatibility issues arise, try pinning versions:
# python -m pip install osmnx==1.6.0 networkx==2.8.8
```

If you're behind a proxy or on a corporate network, add `--proxy` flags or configure environment variables beforehand.

### Plugin Installation
- Copy the plugin folder `fire_analysis_plugin` into your QGIS profile plugins directory.
  Example (Windows):
  - `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins\fire_analysis_plugin`
- Restart QGIS and enable the plugin via **Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins**.

### Usage
1) Load into your project an incident layer (points/polygons) and a fire stations layer (points).
2) Open **Processing Toolbox** → group `Fire Response Analysis`.
3) Run the desired algorithm and configure parameters:
   - `Incident layer`, `Fire stations layer` — input data.
   - `Average speeds / Speed profile` — optional; defaults are used if not provided.
   - For routes: choose a mode and, if applicable, set a time threshold.
4) Save the output layer (point/polygon for nearest station; line for routes; same geometry type as input for all-stations-by-rank analysis).

#### Route Generation Modes

### Default Speed Profile (km/h)
- **1**: Urban arterial / primary roads — 49
- **2**: Secondary / district roads — 37
- **3**: Local / residential streets — 26
- **4**: Service / access roads — 16
- **5**: Pedestrian paths / drivable non-roads — 5

These values are used to assign speeds to OSM graph edges based on the `highway` tag.

| Group | OSM highway                  | Speed (km/h) |
|-------|------------------------------|--------------|
| 1     | trunk, motorway(+_link), primary(+_link) | 49 |
| 2     | secondary(+_link), unclassified          | 37 |
| 3     | tertiary(+_link), residential, living_street | 26 |
| 4     | road, service, track                    | 16 |
| 5     | footway, path, pedestrian, steps, cycleway, bridleway, corridor | 5 |

### Tips and Limitations
- **OSM Completeness**: Route accuracy depends on the completeness and recency of OpenStreetMap data in your area of interest.
- **Graph Loading**: For large extents, increase the buffer cautiously — it affects graph size and computation time.
- **CRS**: Algorithms handle coordinate transformations correctly, but input layers must have valid CRS definitions.
- **OSMnx**: If the graph fails to load, a clear error message will appear; ensure required packages are installed in the QGIS Python environment.

### Example Outputs
- Nearest station: point/polygon layer with time/distance attributes and station name.
- Routes: line layer with routes and time/distance attributes for each object–station pair.
- All stations by rank: layer with aggregated metrics (`first/last/avg_arrival_min`) and a list of responding stations.
